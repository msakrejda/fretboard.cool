before shipping:
* toggle selected pitchClass instead of temp highlight
* add router with routes for all parameters
* vendor soundfont
* animate transitions
* add about page
* mobile
* lint
* adjust chord / arpeggio to tuning + fret count

* multiple diagrams on screen at the same time
* print css
* superimpose arpeggios on scale maybe?
* choose marker colors
