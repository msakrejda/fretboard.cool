before shipping:

later:
* key-oriented navigation (pick key, then easily switch I / II / IV / V / etc.)
* multiple diagrams on screen at the same time
* print css
* superimpose arpeggios on scale maybe?
* choose marker colors
* custom tuning
* toggle selected pitchClass instead of temp highlight maybe?
